          üè† I was born & raised in Uttar Pradesh, India.
        </li>
        <li class="about-section-content__list-item">
          üñ•Ô∏è Ever since I was a kid, I've always been captivated by the
          &quot;What&quot; &amp; the &quot;How&quot; of computers; So much that
          when it came to choosing a career path, I didn't even think twice.
        </li>
        <li class="about-section-content__list-item">
          <span class="code-emoji">&lt;/&gt;</span> I picked up Web Development
          in my first year of college as a certification course. Back then, I
          was trying to learn HTML & CSS like any other programming language.
          This mindset gradually matured to just remembering keywords &
          searching the docs, to learning about responsive designs, to version
          control systems like Git & GitHub, to JavaScript & it's unconventional
          experience as a programming language, back to semantic HTML and then
          finally to where I'm right now: learning the inner workings of CSS,
          while learning design principles that improve UX along the way. And I
          know there is so much more to learn out there. The more I learn about
          the tech, the more I cherish it.

      <p class="body-text">
        Due to my recent life experiences, I've opened up to a bunch of new
        avenues on top of my existing interests. These include:

          üìñ Reading was always on my bucket list. As I've come to realize
          recently, only content that has substance & hence a certain amount of
          depth speaks to me. So reading for me acts as the perfect gateway to
          wonder about anything.<br />‚ô¶ Currently Reading:
          <cite>Digital Minimalism</cite>

        <li class="hobbies-section-content__list-item">
          üé® Drawing is another hobby I picked up recently. I've always been
          enchanted by visual artwork. So when I got the chance to pick up
          something new, there were no doubts! I've been trying out sketching
          since then.

          üßπ I've always been a hygiene person all my life. But it's the
          therapeutic effects of cleaning that drew me towards it. I feel
          blissfully free of real-world stress when I unplug this way.
        </li>
        <li class="hobbies-section-content__list-item">
          üéÆ Video Gaming used to be my most beloved hobby until recently. This
          was the same time when I realized that I wasn't drawn towards casual
          games as I once used to be. My preference had shifted towards titles
          with a heavier focus on story & character design. This is another
          reason why I knew reading would work better for me with the amount of
          depth books offer.

          üéûÔ∏è I used to consume a fair bit of video content in the past. And
          though I still do sometimes, it's only when the content reflects my
          values.<br />‚ô¶ Favourite Movie Of all-time: <cite>3 Idiots</cite

    This is my portfolio website in the making. I'll soon make changes here.
    I've made 2 cli apps in nodeJs. First one is MEmory Quiz(v2023) which
    quizzes user about their knowledge of me. Second one is Mytho Mania which
    quizzes user about their knowledge on Hindu Mythology.
