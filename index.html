          üñ•Ô∏è Ever since I was a kid, I've always been captivated by the
          &quot;What&quot; &amp; the &quot;How&quot; of computers; So much that
          when it came to choosing a career path, I didn't even think twice.

          <span class="code-emoji">&lt;/&gt;</span> I picked up Web Development
          in my first year of college as a certification course. Back then, I
          was trying to learn HTML & CSS like any other programming language.
          This mindset gradually matured to just remembering keywords &
          searching the docs, to learning about responsive designs, to version
          control systems like Git & GitHub, to JavaScript & it's unconventional
          experience as a programming language, back to semantic HTML and then
          finally to where I'm right now: learning the inner workings of CSS,
          while learning design principles that improve UX along the way. And I
          know there is so much more to learn out there. The more I learn about
          the tech, the more I cherish it.

    This is my portfolio website in the making. I'll soon make changes here.
    I've made 2 cli apps in nodeJs. First one is MEmory Quiz(v2023) which
    quizzes user about their knowledge of me. Second one is Mytho Mania which
    quizzes user about their knowledge on Hindu Mythology.
